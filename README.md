## ðŸ–¥ Your Job

Your job is to create a simple app with a backend and a client, with a special emphasis on quality. Feel free to use whatever tools you feel more comfortable with for the frontend and the backend, but those must be separated (single-page application). Youâ€™ll get extra points if the tool can be easily run on our machines.

## ðŸ’ª The Challenge

**Your challenge is to build a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics in a usable way.** Each metric will have a timestamp, name, and value. The metrics will be shown in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day and persisted in the database.

The maximum time for the challenge is 8 hours in the time frame we establish. Feel free to use any tools you need, but remember to keep your code accessible on the public GitHub repository and use one of our technologies (React, Next.js...). If possible include both the backend and frontend code in the same repo.

## âœ… To evaluate

Once you deliver the challenge, weâ€™ll schedule a second meeting with the rest of the team to evaluate your coding process, your ability to write clean code, and beautiful CSS (you can use preprocessors like Sass, Stylus, CSS-in-JS,..., or vanilla CSS), your ability to analyze and test your solution, and your capacity to prioritize the project and your decisions.
